Of course. Here is the fully updated, aesthetically enhanced `README.md` file.

This version incorporates a more visually appealing design, a dedicated section to encourage stars and support, and uses a refined set of symbols for the project structure. The "Repo Size" badge URL is correct and will automatically update from 0B as soon as you commit and push files to the repository.

-   An OpenAI API Key (optional, but required for AI features)

### Installation

1️⃣ **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mixtrus/AI-CV-GEN.git
   cd AI-CV-GEN
   ```

2️⃣ **Install PHP dependencies with Composer:**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3️⃣ **Set up your environment file:**
